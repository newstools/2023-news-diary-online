By Chimezie Godfrey The Labour Party (LP) has dissolved its Rivers State Executive Council over alleged gross anti-party activities and corruption. According to the National Chairman, Labour Party, Barrister Julius Abure, the National Working Committee arising from an emergency meeting on Tuesday in Abuja, believed that it was in the interest of the Labour Party and the Obidient movement in Rivers State that those who were at the helm of affairs in Rivers State when “our presidential mandate was openly stolen in Rivers State should step aside until full investigation on what happened on that day is completed”.   Abure said,”The national working committee has dissolved the Labour Party State Executive Council of Rivers State with immediate effect, for gross anti-party activities and corruption in the management of Labour Party funds “The National Working Committee has lost confidence in the ability of the compromised State Executive Council led by Mr Deinye Pepple to lead the campaign for the gubernatorial and State House of Assembly elections come March 11th.   “The National Working Committee urges all Obidients in Rivers State to disregard every comment made by the disgraced State Chairman of the Labour Party, Deinye Pepple, on the election of March 11th and reiterates the full backing of the Labour Party on the candidacy of Comrade Beatrice Itubo of the Labour Party as the next Governor of Rivers State. “The National Working Committee therefore enjoins all Obidients to come out massively on March 11th to vote for Comrade Beatrice Itubo of Labour Party.”
