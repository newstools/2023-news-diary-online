by Alaba-Olusola Oke A lawmaker in Ondo State, Mr Sunday  Olajide, has advised former Vice President Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and his Labour Party counterpart, Mr Peter Obi, to accept their defeat in the Feb. 25 Presidential election.  Olajide, representing Akure South Constituency 2 in the Ondo State House of Assembly, on Wednesday in Akure, said that though every Nigerian had the constitutional right to seek redress of an injury in court, it would be statesmanship if the duo could let go. “The duo of Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi should accept the outcome of the election.   “Going to the court will amount to a mere academic exercise and will achieve nothing. “Sen. Bola Tinubu won the election fair and square, and the results of the presidential election were a true reflection of Nigerians’ sincere votes,” he stated.  Olajide said that Nigerians have elected Tinubu and Sen. Kashim Shettima as their most preferred leaders for the next administration. The lawmaker also congratulated the President-elect and the Vice President-elect for the hard-fought victory at the just concluded presidential  elections.  “The duo has demonstrated once more that they are dogged fighters  in our quest for the establishment of a just and egalitarian society.  “I have no doubt that you will ride on the crest of the momentum of this triumph to lead our motherland to greatness and prosperity,” Olajide said. The lawmaker urged indigenes of the state resident in Lagos to troop out in large numbers on Saturday and vote for the re-election of  Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu “Gov. Sanwoolu has delivered massively in the provision of infrastructure in the state. He has delivered key infrastructure, which includes Imota Rice Mill and invested on  road construction and other signature projects such as the inauguration of the 4th mainland bridge,” he said.( NAN)
