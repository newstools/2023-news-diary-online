President-elect Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has expressed sorrow over the loss of elder statesman Alhaji Musa Musawa. Born on April 1, 1937 the deceased was a broadcaster, diplomat and astute politician. He died on Tuesday following a protracted illness. Alhaji Musa Musawa is survived by a number of children and other family members including the deputy spokesperson of the APC Presidential Campaign Council,  Barrister Hannatu Musawa. In a statement Tuesday evening by his media office, Asiwaju Tinubu described the late statesman from Katsina as one of the last bastions of freedom fighters who fought for Nigeria’s independence. “He was a truly progressive and broadminded statesman. As a young man, he joined forces with like-minded comrades in the defunct Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) to fight for Independence and total liberation of our people. “In the years since independence Alhaji Musa Musawa continued to (align) with progressive movements in and outside the realm of politics to advance the (cause) of the poor and oppressed in the society. “He was a progressive politician who paid his dues as a dedicated patriot. Nigeria has lost an illustrious son and we would miss his fatherly counsel at a time we need it the most,” Tinubu said. The president-elect prayed Almighty Allah to forgive the shortcomings of the departed elder and offered his family the needed consolation at their moment of grief.
