By Abiodun Lawal Speaker of Ogun House of Assembly,  Olakunle Oluomo, has appealed to residents of the state to remain calm in the face of daunting challenges created by the ongoing currency swap of the Federal Government. Oluomo stated this while speaking with newsmen in Abeokuta on Monday.  The speaker urged them not to yield space to anti- democratic elements to hijack the election process. He added that the effects of the ongoing fiscal policy being implemented through the Central Bank of Nigeria had affected Nigerians.  Oluomo stated that able bodied men and women now spent better part of working hours at the banks’ ATM points. ” It is important to acknowledge that the currency swap is good for the economy. ” The process of its implementation as currently being experienced has created a lot of socio-economic hardships for Nigerians.  ” We should thus remain calm and not to allow anti-democratic elements to hijack the process. ” We should endure to the last, and come out en-masse on Saturday to exercise our franchise for the candidates of our choice,” the speaker said.(NAN)
