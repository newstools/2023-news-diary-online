By Bushrah Yusuf-Badmus The Kwara Government has offered fifty per cent transport support to Kwara students returning home from tertiary institutions to observe the three weeks election break. This is contained in a statement from the Press Secretary, Ministry of Tertiary Education, Mrs Mansurat Amuda-kannike, on Monday in Ilorin.   Amuda-kannike quoted the Commissioner, Dr Afees Alabi, as saying that the support would be monetised and transferred to the beneficiaries after verifications. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the Nigeria Universities Commission had directed Nigerian universities be closed for a duration of three weeks between Feb. 22 and March 14.   ”It is interesting to note that this 50 per cent transport support is coming barely 12 hours after Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq-led administration announced free bus palliative for students of Unilorin and Kwara State Polytechnic which begins on Monday, Feb.13 ”I appreciate the efforts of the AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq-led administration for considering students welfare with utmost priority.   ”The 50 per cent subsidy was meant to augment transportation fares for students returning to Kwara,” Alabi said.
