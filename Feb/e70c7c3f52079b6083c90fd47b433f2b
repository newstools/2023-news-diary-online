By Chimezie Godfrey The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has secured the conviction of a former Permanent Secretary, Peter Ayeni and Director of Finance and Account, Pius Ojemolon at the Edo State Universal Basic Education Board (ESUBEB), over allegations bordering on fraud, conspiracy and abuse of office. The Spokesperson of the ICPC, Mrs Azuka Ogugua in a statement on Wednesday said the ICPC had, in a 2-count charge brought before Hon. Justice Acha J.
