by Ejike Obeta  Rivers governor Nyesom Wike got disappointed in his unit 7 voting point of ward 9, Obio/Akpo Local Government on Saturday as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machine failed to accredit him to enable him vote.   The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the BVAS failed to recognise the thumb or face of Wike and his wife, Suzzet, as the Presiding Officer, Agatha Abiokun, battled in vain to to have them accredited. Abiokun, however, pleaded with the governor to wait as she had sent for an INEC technician to rectify the anomaly.  An obviously miffed Wike expressed disappointment over the development and accused INEC of failing to prepare properly for the assignment. “INEC ought to have put all its tools in order before now.  “We are highly disappointed. INEC told us they were ready for the election and that the BVAS machines were working. “You can see the crowd here; I don’t think that most people will be able to vote with the slow working of the BVAS.  “I have stayed here for about 25 minutes. I was told to go and come back. “We are highly disappointed. If a number of people are disenfranchised, what do you expect? People will lose their temper and anything could happen. “INEC ought to have been completely ready before telling the people they are ready,” he said. (NAN)
