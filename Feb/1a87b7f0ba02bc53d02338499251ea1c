We understand that goods and shops worth billions of naira have been destroyed by the raging fire.   “This is a great loss to the country’s economy, especially Borno state which is just beginning to recover from the destruction and losses as a result of insurgency and banditry. We sympathize with the state government and people of Borno state, especially the traders whose livelihoods have gone up in flames following the fire incident. “I have directed the National Emergency Management Agency NEMA to help with Search and Rescue operations of property to see what can be salvaged and to ascertain the level of damage and loss at the Monday Market,” she said.
