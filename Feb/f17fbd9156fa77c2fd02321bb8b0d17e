He urged them to be good ambassadors of Nigeria and abide by rules and regulations for a hitch-free exercise.  Pam tasked pilgrims to be prayerful for continued peace as well as stability of the nation and peaceful elections to be accepted as will of God. “This is the eight batch, the first batch started Dec 16. in Enugu International Airport. All of the batches became prayer warriors for the general elections.  “And today, you can see how the election is going, if not because of prayers by now Nigeria could have been something else. So your prayers have to be higher for governorship elections to be successful,” he said.  He also warned pilgrims against absconding and to engage in religious aspects of life while at the Holy land.  Pam commended President Muhammadu Buhari and Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri for their support and cooperation to the commission and the pilgrims. In his remarks, Rev.
