By Monday Ijeh The Police Service Commission (PSC) has appointed retired AIG Bawa Lawal as the coordinator for the North West to monitor the conduct of police personnel in the general election.  The appointment is contained in a state issued by Mr Ikechukwu Ani, the Head of Press and Public Relations of PSC in Abuja. Ani said Lawal, a Commissioner of the PSC was earlier appointed to coordinate the zone with Mrs Najatu Mohammed, also a commissioner with the commission.  He said the appointment of Lawal followed objections raised by the All Progressives Congress  Presidential campaign Council on the appointment of Mohammed. Ani said Mohammed, the commissioner representing Women Interest and the North West was earlier appointed as one of the Coordinators for the region in the general elections.  The PSC spokesman said the appointment of Mohammed was criticised by the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council on grounds of partisanship. The campaign council, he said, described the appointment as not only “callous, but insensitive and therefore,  unacceptable. “The commission wishes to state with all sense of responsibility that it’s commissioners representing different geopolitical zones have always supervised assignments of the Commission in the geopolitical zones they represent. “The commission has however, decided to mandate Lawal, who is from the same geopolitical Zone with Mohammed to take over the coordination of the monitoring of Police Conduct in the zone. “The commission will always be sensitive to the wishes of Nigerians and  will continue to contribute it’s quota to the sustenance of the nation’s democracy,” he said.
