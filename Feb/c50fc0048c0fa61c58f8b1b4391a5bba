By Aminu Garko The Labour Party (LP) in Kano State, has dismissed claims that Bashir Ishak-Bashir, who defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC), was its gubernatorial candidate. Ishak-Bashir had on Monday told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that he had commenced talks with the APC to support it in the forthcoming elections.   “I am in high level discussion with the leadership of the All Progressive Congress (APC) at the national level on how we can support the party win the forthcoming general elections. “I will soon get across to you on our final position on the matter,” Ishak-Bashir told NAN.   The LP Chairman in the state, Alhaji Mohammed Raji, however, dismissed Ishak-Bashir’s claims, saying he was never the LP governorship candidate. Raji said at a news conference on Monday in Kano that Ishak-Bashir’s name has never been on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) portal as LP’s gubernatorial flag bearer in Kano state.   “He came to the party alone and left alone,” Raji said, adding that the structure of the party remained intact with all its Senatorial, House of Representatives and State Assembly candidates contesting in the forthcoming general elections. He, however, acknowledged that there were issues in the party which had “caused disunity within the rank and file of members of the party.”   Raji added that “some wrong elements” had tried to divert the attention of the party and threatened to defect. “We are strongly advising such category of people to know that we the ‘Obedients’ are fully in support of Obi/Dati movement hundred per cent in Kano state,” he added.   Meanwhile, a source in the party said that Raji’s name has been forwarded to INEC as the LP gubernatorial candidate in Kano state. (NAN)
