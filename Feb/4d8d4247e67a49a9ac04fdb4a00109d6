By Joshua Oladipo The Muslim Initiative on Right and Justice (MIRAJ) , an NGO has called on the Federal Government to urgently put an end to issues surrounding scarcity of new Naira notes.  MIRAJ president, Mr Adeniyi Adams said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Osogbo. Adams said the new monetary policy introduced by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) under the tutelage of Mr Godwin Emefiele had brought long suffering and untold hardship to many Nigerians.  He said that the due to the currency redesign, money in circulation had become scarce making daily transactions tasking and unbearable. “We, the Muslim Initiative on Right and Justice expressed sadness over the issue of Naira redesign, which is unbearable.  “The situation has now thrown millions of Nigerians into confusion due to different sources of information from designated authorities,” Adams said. According to him, the need to take a drastic solution on the current trend becomes paramount hence the right time to act fast is now.  Adama said that Nigerians must unite against anti-masses policy irrespective of political tendencies, religious background and ethnicity. “No ambition is greater than our collective survival as a people and individual interest cannot override the interest of the masses.’’ The group claimed that there was no transparency and accountability in the redesigned CBN monetary policy, describing it as “immoral and is a breach of the provisions of the Code of Conduct’’. Adams, however, appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to rescue the situation before it got out of hands, suggesting that the new monetary policies by the apex bank be suspended for the meantime.
