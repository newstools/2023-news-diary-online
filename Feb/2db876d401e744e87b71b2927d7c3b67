KADUNA UPDATE: Let us stand up strongly for democracy, peace and national unity State Broadcast by Malam Nasir El-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State, 16th February 2023. My dear people of Kaduna State, a. Create a nationwide shortage of cash so that citizens are incited to vote against APC candidates across the board resulting in massive losses for the Party in all the elections; b. Ensure that the cash crunch is so serious, along with the contrived and enduring fuel shortage existing since September 2022, that the 2023 Elections do not hold at all, leading to an Interim National Government to be led by a retired Army General; c. Sustain the climate of shortage of fuel, food and other necessities, leading to mass protests, violence and breakdown of law and order that would provide a fertile foundation for a military take-over; Thank you all for listening. God Bless Kaduna State. God Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai, CONKaduna, 16th February 2023
