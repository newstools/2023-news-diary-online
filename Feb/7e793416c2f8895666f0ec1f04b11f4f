According to Dr. Dahiru, “Collaboration in these areas will improve social and economic conditions in the Niger Delta and the country as a whole.” Responding, the Managing Director/CEO of the NDDC, Dr. Samuel Ogbuku, said that the Commission was committed to partnering with agencies and entities willing to contribute to the development of the Niger Delta. He noted that it was in furtherance of this objective that the NDDC had set up the Public Private Partnership Committee recently to foster various forms of development-focused collaboration.” Details of the talks between the NDDC and NASENI’s Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer were still being expected at the time of this report.
