The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) gathered that the gunmen, numbering more than six, came on motorcycles to the area and started shooting to scare away the voters.  NAN learnt that the gunmen attacked Owoseni, Ijaye, Branco, Owolabi, Fadeyi streets amongst others that formed the cluster units, collected some of the ballot boxes containing papers already thumb printed and set them on fire.  “The unknown gunmen came in around 12 noon and started shooting.

The Commissioner of police in Lagos State, CP Idowu Owohunwa, who visited the area at about 1.07 p.m. evacuated 25 Ad-hoc INEC officials from the units attacked and took them to the police command headquarters.
