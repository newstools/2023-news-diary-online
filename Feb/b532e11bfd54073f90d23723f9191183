We do not have enough security manning the various polling units.  “There are conflicts everywhere, insecurity, attacks on All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates everywhere,” he said.Omo-Agege commended the electorate for the large turnout.“I am glad that today, we are electing the President, this will determine the kind of Nigeria we will have in the next eight years. “We have opportunity to make that decision and it is my hope and expectation that they do the right thing.   “And as far as the governorship election is concerned, there is a concession that there is the need for change and the people are tired of Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa and everything he represents,” he said. He stated that APC was sure of victory at all levels in the election.“As far as the Presidential, Senatorial, Governorship, House of Representatives, houses of Assembly elections are concerned, we are very sure we are going to win.  “I think it is the expectation of everyone in the state come March 11, we will emerge victorious,” he said.
