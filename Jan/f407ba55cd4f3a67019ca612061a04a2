By Jacinta Nwachukwu The security challenge in some parts of the country has presented various headachesto governments, the military and the entire society. While some such as food security and crime are easily noticeable, others go largelyunnoticed. One of such is the increasing number of births at the Internally DisplacedPersons (IDPs) camps where sexually active by largely idle men and women live.A report from the Benue State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) shows that80 babies were delivered by the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp in the statein seven months. The Executive Secretary, SEMA, Dr Emmanuel Shior, said this in Makurdi at themonthly distribution of relief materials to displaced persons in the state.Shior explained that most of the IDPs co-habited with their partners, hence the highnumber of births recorded in the camps. While saying that SEMA is very strict on illicit sexual affairs in the camps, he,however, expressed concern at its difficulty to control the rate of births in the camps. Similarly, Mrs Evelyn Omijie, Assistant Coordinator of the IDPs camp in Edo said 20babies have been born in the camp in seven years.Omijie said the babies were born by married young couples among the IDPs whowere allowed to stay together.“We did not record any unwanted births among the singles in the camp. We have astandard in the camp, and this includes the demarcation of the females’ living quartersfrom the males’ living quarters.“We also teach morals and let them understand that they already have enough on theirhands which is being in the camp because of their displacement, so it is pertinent thatthey live a meaningful life,” she said.She said with such guidance, counseling and training, the management of the camphas been able to ensure and maintain sanity in the camp among the IDPs.The story is not different at IDPs camp, Durumi in the Federal Capital Territory(FCT), Abuja.Mrs Liyatu Ayuba, Women Leader and a traditional birth attendant in the camp saidthat she had helped expectant mothers to deliver over 218 babies.Ayuba, who said that she had spent nine years in the camp, explained that afterdelivery she usually took the child and mother to hospital for proper care. She said that she was trained for four months on how to deliver babies which she hasbeen doing successfully by the grace of God.It is also observed that these camps existed through three states which are Borno,Yobe and Adamawa.On the best way to manage population among IDPs, the Nigerian Army Officer WivesAssociation (NAOWA) underscored the need for women in the camps to observefamily planning for improved family life.The wife of Military Secretary, Mrs Maryam Abdussalam, who visited some womenat the Durumi IDPs camp, also donated relief materials to them in commemoration of2022 Nigerian Army Day celebration.According to her, family planning is central to gender equality even as womenempowerment is a key factor in reducing poverty.According to Abdussalam the Association will engage medical doctors to educate thewomen in the camps on effective family planning.Abdussalam explained that controlling the number of children individuals and orcouples have as well as spacing and timing of their births would help for properfamily management.We see a lot of children that have been born here and there is no place for recreational activities for them. I am going through some emotions seeing the children and the women here;honestly there are a lot that needs to be done.“We are going to involve some doctors, or corps members to come here and talk tothem on what to do,’’ she said.Meanwhile, global estimates indicate that the number of people displaced annually byconflict and violence has increased since 2003.In Nigeria a report by the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and InternallyDisplaced Persons shows that as of December2021 the number of IDPs in Nigeriastood at 3.1 million.They were displaced due to insurgency, political instability and the activities ofterrorist groups, particularly in the North-East.Analysts say that because of the severe social instability the IDPs experienced, theyare likely to have irregular access to family planning and little control over theirsexual encounters.They say these factors placed IDPs at an increased risk for unintendedpregnancies, poorly spaced or high-risk pregnancies, and sexuallytransmitted infections (STIs). Furthermore, adolescents living in IDP camps are at a high risk of being sexuallyabused and exploited.They observe that reproductive health care services are rarely adequately provided bygovernment and other stakeholders working with IDPs.According to them, the inadequacy of family planning services among IDP camps hasfailed to measure up with the family planning needs of the IDPs leading to a series ofunmet needs with devastating consequences.Medical experts say increasing their need for a range of complementary servicesincluding appropriate contraceptives and counseling will help to moderate their familysize.Mr Julius Ankpa, a marriage counselor says government and NGOs should establishcentres in the various IDP camps where the people can have easy access to familyplanning services.Government should also consider returning some of the IDPs back to their communities where relative peace has returned. This is because it is assumed that outside the camp, it is easy for the people to accessthese facilities.“They will also have less time to spend together as couples. Most of the people areidle while in the camp and this partly explains the population growth in the camps,”he said. (NANFeatures)
