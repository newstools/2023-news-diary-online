The political “analogy” widely circulated on the social media in recent days by the Kaduna State Chapter of Naka Sai Naka [roughly translated as Only Yours] campaign, that the 2023 election in Nigeria is going to be analogous to the 1979 presidential election, deserves closer scrutiny. The group claims that “Peter Obi/Labour Party is analogous to Azikiwe/NPP [of the Second Republic]. That Tinubu/APC is analogous to Awolowo/UPN. That Atiku/PDP is analogous to Shagari/NPN, and that Kwankwaso/NNPP is analogous to Aminu Kano/PRP.”It then added: “1. Aminu Kano was from Kano and won only in Kano State. (Kwankwaso will do the same). My observations are: So all the Naka Sai Naka analogies are fraudulent. A hush, pro-PDP Naka Sai Naka campaign is historically fraudulent because it was PDP that brought Chief Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999 and convinced Northerners that he was a tried and tested friend of the region.Two can play the same game. It is now APC’s turn to bring Tinubu and say he is a tested friend of the region. Naka Sai Naka is not true. It is also dangerous. What happens to Nigeria if every region says Naka Sai Naka?
