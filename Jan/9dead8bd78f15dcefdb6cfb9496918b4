Omisanya-Odunlami said that the police had begun investigation into the case and advised residents to always report suspicious movements around them to the police for prompt action. “People should be very conscious because for somebody to have dumped a corpse and even burnt it in an area and nobody knew about it is worrying.   “This is what we have been telling people that when you see something, say something. “If you see any suspicious move in your area, get in touch with the police because this is not the time to look away.   “If anyone had accosted the person dumping something in the gutter, there would have been a way to see what was in the sack and the perpetrator of such evil act would have been apprehended,” she said.
