By Ismaila Chafe President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the appointment of Obadiah Nkom as Director General of the Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office for a second and final term of four years .  Mr Femi Adesina, the president’s spokesman, who confirmed this development in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, said the appointment takes effect from Jan. 12, 2023.  Nkom was first appointed on Jan. 12, 2019 for an initial period of four years. Adesina said that under the leadership of Nkom in the past four years, the Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office recorded 86 per cent increase in revenue generation.  Also, the office raked in over N8.9 billion between 2019 and 2021, compared to N4.8 billion generated in the corresponding period of 2016 – 2018.
