By Bridget Ikyado Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige has urged Nigerians to approach the New Year with positive mindsets and remain hopeful for a greater Nigeria. The minister gave the advice in his new year message on Sunday in Abuja. According to him, while the challenges facing Nigerians were daunting, they are not insurmountable, hence the need for all to approach the New Year with positive mindsets.   “As we celebrate the beginning of 2023, we must also look back on the outgone year, with the knowledge that brighter days are ahead of us. “Athough our challenges are daunting, we must be courageous and determined to rise up and meet them.   “It is this spirit that will keep us going until we reach the desired destination of a prosperous and bountiful Nigeria that our founding fathers fought for,” he added. Ngige used the opportunity to thank Nigerian workers for their support to the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and himself since 2015.   He said the administration had prioritised workers welfare from inception, and remained committed to them as it winds down in five months.(NAN)
