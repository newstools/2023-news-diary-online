Similarly,  Mr Misbahu Muhammad, the Chairman, Jigawa State Anti-Corruption Network, expressed satisfaction with level of INEC’s preparations for the election.“The success of the election depends not only on the effort of the electoral body, but security agencies, political parties and the electorate.“From the look of things and based on the activities of the INEC, we believe that the electoral body will hold the election as scheduled.“However, the success of this election depends not only on INEC, but on security agencies, political parties and voters themselves.“To us, vote buying can be a major challenge during the election, even though the INEC will technologies to deal with the issue.“But the vote buyers can decided to use other means to influence voters like textile materials and others even if they cannot use money during the election.“So it will be good if the INEC collaborates with all security agencies to ensure free, fair and credible elections,” he said.On his part, Dr Abdulmalik Sa’ad, a lecturer in Bauchi, advocated for proactive security measures to secure INEC facilities, election workers, materials and voters. He said that security is the key to successful election process, adding, “INEC and the politicians have committed themselves at the level of preparations all are set for the elections. “But there is a security challenge, we are appealing to security agencies to be on alert and seize all unregistered arms from individuals wielding them,” he said. However, Mr Jinjiri Garba, Chairman, Bauchi State Network of Civil Society Organisations (BASNEC), decried low pace of preparations for the election by the electoral body and politicians. He faulted the process of PVCs distribution, adding the trend exposed the commission’s ability to conduct the exercise according to the election time table. “On the other hand the politicians instead of presenting issue base campaign, they are attacking one another which may culminate into something else. “The security breach on INEC facilities poses another threat to the general election,” he said, adding that security challenges remained a source of concern for the election managers. “For many years, Nigeria has been grappling with its own insecurity in the North-East, the long-standing Boko Haram insurgency has continued “In the North-West and the North-Central, banditry, terrorism and the herder-farmer conflicts, in the South-South and South-West, all have their peculiarity of security challenges which might affect conduct of election,” he said.
