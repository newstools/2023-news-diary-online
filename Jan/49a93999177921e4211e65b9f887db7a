She said that for the same period, 70 victims were brought out dead from different incidences, while properties estimated to be about N15.09 billion were also lost.  The director explained that of the 1,130 calls, 93 were for rescue operations, stressing that eight building collapse incidences and one explosion were attended to.

The service received 984 calls for fire incidences, 99 calls for rescue operations, while about N11.95 billion properties were lost to fire in 2021. NAN also reports that the director told the fire men during the Service 2023 First Bi- Annual Staff Engagement for Firemen, to reduce fire outbreaks in Lagos State and further enhance service delivery. The theme for the meeting, “Integrating the Workforce for Effective Service Delivery”. Adeseye said that the essence of the meeting was to network, share ideas that would be beneficial to prevention of fire outbreaks in the state. “Fire incidences increased indiscriminately from November through December 2022, and investigations revealed carelessness and negligence as the major causes. “Other factors include fuel scarcity and Harmattan haze, which also triggers the increase of fire outbreaks,” she noted. Adeseye, therefore, urged residents of Lagos to desist from habits that may put their lives and properties in harms way, and assured the public that the fire agency had what it took to ensure reduction of fire outbreaks.
