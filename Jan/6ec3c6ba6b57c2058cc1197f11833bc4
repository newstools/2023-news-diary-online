Nnamani said he would serve the interest of Aba North and South Constituency in the House of Representatives as well as enrich the lives of all Nigerians through his legislative interventions He said that he would ensure that the befitting Constitution spurred Nigeria’s development instead of holding it down.  “It is time we voted people who are vocal enough to challenge the legitimacy of the document that is the 1999 Constitution that has held Nigeria’s progress backwards for quite some time now.  “It is quite sad that none of our legislators had confronted the leadership of the National Assembly on how redress some key issues in the 1999 Constitution. “I will take that on and I am not going there to become a sleeping or docile member,’’ he said. Nnamani also promised to change the style of representation of the people of Aba North and South constituency by giving them a participatory democratic system.
